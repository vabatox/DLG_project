Notes...

1) there are 2 solutions, one for jupyter(dlg_test_pyspark.ipynb) and one .py (dlg_test_pyspark.py)
2) I initially tested on a sample of the 2 .csv files. I have included my test files.
3) I did not count any data where pressure column is null, as these ScreenTemperature defaulted to -99
4) A assumed ScreenTemperature = Temperature
5) All 3 answers are printed in the .py and .ipynb.
6) All 3 answers have been output to /tmp/hottest_day,/tmp/hottest_day_temp/ & /tmp/hottest_day_region/
7) I have used pyspark rather than pandas
